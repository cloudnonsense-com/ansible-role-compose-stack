## Task
Perform a code review of this whole codebase. I want to see a list of: 
- Design Issues; 
- Recommendations; 
- Quality Score (with 1-to-10 quality scoring on Architecture, Testing, Maintainability and Documentation)
- save the report under ".ignore/<YYYY-MM-DD-HH_MM_SS>-codereport.md"
- make it as compact and as short as possible
- only highlight critical, major and medium level issues
- highlight anything that can be drastically simplified
